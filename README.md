# Salon Web Application

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a salon web application. The application is designed to provide a seamless experience for both clients and administrators. Below you'll find information about the frontend design architecture, client-view features, admin-view features, and the backend server tasks to be completed.

## Frontend Design Architecture

The frontend design architecture is structured to cater to both client and admin views, with separate home index pages for each. Here [visit the client](todo-client.md) documention for more details.

### Client-View:

The client-view provides various functionalities for general users visiting the website. Users can explore services, products, gallery, and contact information. Authorized users gain additional features such as making reservations and shopping.

### Admin-View:

The admin-view empowers administrators with tools for managing the salon's inventory, services, reservations, users, and analytics. It provides a dynamic interface for efficient salon management.

## Backend Server Architecture

The backend server tasks include the development of various APIs to support the functionality of the salon web application. Here [visit the server](todo-server.md) documentation for more details.

### Tasks:

- [ ] User API
- [ ] Product API
- [ ] Category API
- [ ] Reservation API
- [ ] Service API
- [ ] Gallery API
- [ ] Analytics API

Each task represents an API that needs to be implemented to support the salon's operations.
